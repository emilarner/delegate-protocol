# delegate-protocol
The specification for the Delegate Protocol--a messaging service similar to Discord, Matrix, and/or IRC. 

The specification shall be in the *Delegate Protocol.pdf* file. The specification is not finished; additionally, some technical aspects of it may be incorrect or inefficient, with the consideration that it is an amateur project. This project is not currently being worked on, with it being an old project that was last worked upon a year or so ago. This GitHub account shall also post implementations of the Delegate Protocol: a server, client library, and client (written in Python).
